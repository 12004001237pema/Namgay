<h2>The Peaceful  of Bhutan</h2>
<p>It's easy to see why the tiny Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan was closed off to the rest of the world for so long. Focused on happiness and well-being, Bhutan offers a slice of life that makes it one of the most unique and highly desirable destinations in the world. </p><br/>
                        <p>Imagine a place where smoking is illegal and they don't have street lights as they are deemed as unfriendly â€“ Bhutan, a place we knew little about but are so grateful they are now allowing visitors into their enchanting utopian world.

<p>Another highlight while touring the Thimphu Valley is the National Memorial Chorten which is another visible landmark of the region. Built in 1974 in memoriam to the third king of Bhutan, this Tibetan style stupa is a place of worship for many Bhutanese.</p> <br/>
                        <p>Tourists are welcome, however, in the evening it is discouraged as many worshipers would like this time to practice their faith without any onlookers. Regardless when you are there, it is a memorable experience to be in a place that evokes such an ambiance of utter peace and tranquillity.</p>
